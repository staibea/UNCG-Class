Note: Sorry this is late! I forgot the turn in schedule was on Sundays for this class, I had it in my head this was due on Monday 🤦‍♀️.

Website Components

Initially, I had to familiarize myself with what the components of a website were. My criteria for evaluating the University of North Carolina Greensboro library’s webpage considered their content, ease of navigation, imagery, accessibility, Front page Header, contact information and responsive design.

A more literal interpretation of the components of a website would be specific elements like headings & subheadings, quotes, links, and body text. I decided to evaluate the functionality of the page since it seems like that would make more sense in context.

First Impressions

The first thing I notice as a user when I get to the library’s page is the color choice—I know from my work that UNCG library staff may not have much design control over their header or color choices. The red & white font and background aren’t the best—yellow and black combos are also not my favorite and are harder to read. The video banner is huge and takes up precious real estate that could be used to showcase services. The video is also busy and too distracting—it’s also not showing information that is particularly helpful. The mobile phone also has the banner, and it takes up half the frontage of the phone screen. 


Secondary pages have better text/background contrast which leads me to believe library staff have more control over these pages.

Usually, the most important services/information comes first on a page, since most users aren’t going to want to spend a long time searching for what they want. Library staff have chosen to highlight renovation news, librarians by major, and reserving a study space. Two of the options deal in physical space and make sense—renovation information acts as an alert to visitors and many students use a library’s study spaces. I’m not sure if I understand why they’ve placed librarians by subject so high up unless it’s helping their faculty locate them. Though liaison librarians would probably be reaching out to faculty at the beginning of each semester, so I’m not sure why it’s so prominent. I would think most student users would not care what a librarian’s liaison subject is—they want general reference help.

The second half of the screen consists of a search bar—it’s interesting they call it the catalog, since it looks like it searches everything (like ECU library’s One Search feature). Most users won’t make it past this point. Users might look for library hours, which is on a secondary page and is nicely organized between buildings—though the calendars are small and difficult to read.

If I were coming to this site for information, I would also be interested in the contact information—they only have one circulation desk number at the bottom of the main page and they don’t clarify what service desk it goes to. As a remote student, who was not an undergrad at UNCG, this may lead me to believe there is only one physical library building. As a user I’d rather have a service desk number for each physical library, so I know who I’m calling. I don’t want to click another button to get to it. 

Navigation on the webpage is smooth and I didn’t see any drop-down boxes. Some links open a new tab while others forward to the next page. I also noticed the library did not have an upcoming events list. They don’t use a lot of photos either; when they do it seems they’ve tried to use photos that don’t “age”. This makes upkeep easy, but also makes for a boring webpage—it would be nice to see more pictures of students using the library. 

The website needs to be reviewed for updates as well, their “Fast Fact” page is current as of 2020/2021…which tells me the rest of the site probably hasn’t been checked in a while.

Conclusion

Priority information provided would suggest that this webpage was created mostly for users to gain access to library and outside resources—specifically research resources and study rooms. For these two things, the webpage does a good job of making the information accessible and easy to get to since they are the first thing a user sees and on are listed a second time lower down on the main page. I think I’d like if library staff were able to use drop-down lists where that huge banner is to convey additional information.
